# JavaSortManager
This is a Java project I have been working on during my fourth week as a Java SDET Trainee at Sparta Global.

The project has been created using Intellij as a Maven project.

After downloading the SortManager project file, the user must run the main class and follow the instructions provided in the console.

The current program has six different sort methods implemented that can be used to sort an array of random integers.

The array size can be designated by the user, initially set at a default size of 10.

The program will then create an array of integers of the designated size with an upperlimit of 100 and a lowerlimit of -100. 

Future improvements to this project could be to add the possibility of the user entering their own array, as well as not limiting the arrays to consist of only integers.
